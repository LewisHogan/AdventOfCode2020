# Advent of Code 2020

## Day One

### Part One

The first task of day one was to find two numbers in a list which when summed together equaled 2020.

Once these numbers were identified, the solution to the puzzle would be the product of these two.

### Part Two

The second task of day one was identical to the first but with one caveat: instead of two numbers to search for, the result was a combination of three numbers.

## Day Two

### Part One

The first task of day two is to count the number of valid passwords within the list of records.

A password is valid if it contains at least n instances of a specified character, and at most m instances (n and m are defined within the record).

### Part Two

The second task of day two remains the same as the first, but has uses different validation criteria.

A password is valid if it contains a character at either index m or n (indices are 1 based instead of 0 based).

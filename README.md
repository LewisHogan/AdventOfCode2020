# Advent of Code 2020

## Day One

### Part One

The first task of day one was to find two numbers in a list which when summed together equaled 2020.

Once these numbers were identified, the solution to the puzzle would be the product of these two.

### Part Two

The second task of day one was identical to the first but with one caveat: instead of two numbers to search for, the result was a combination of three numbers.
